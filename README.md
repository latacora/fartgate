# fartgate

Sometimes, your Fargate containers fail. For some reason it's really hard to
just alert on exit codes other than zero? But no more: fartgate will let you
know when one of your Fargate Tasks is stinking up the room.

It grabs events from CloudWatch Events, runs in a Lambda, and sends them to
wherever you want via [unsiemly][unsiemly].
